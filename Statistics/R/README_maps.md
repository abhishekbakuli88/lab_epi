# Maps

Maps describing the study population.

* Responsible: Merc√®

## Scripts

* `epi_maps.R` creates maps describing the study population
* `epi_map_MC_Estimation.R` creates maps for the Monte Carlo estimates

The scripts expect the KoCo data to be in the standard locations, and in addition

Output is written to `maps_output`.
